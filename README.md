# üçÖ Comparison of Deep Learning Models for Tomato Freshness Stage Recognition

This project presents a comparative study of three deep learning models ‚Äî **YOLOv5m**, **Xception**, and a **Vision Transformer** ‚Äî for the classification of tomato freshness stages: **Fresh**, **At-risk**, and **Rotten**. The project also includes a mobile application demo for real-time prediction.

## üìΩÔ∏è Mobile App Demo

You can find a video demonstration of the mobile app under the [`Application_detector/`](./Application_detector) folder.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images categorized into three classes:

- `Fresh`
- `At-risk`
- `Rotten`

All images were preprocessed and augmented to ensure robustness and generalization across different lighting and environmental conditions.

## üöÄ Models Trained

We trained and evaluated the following models:

- **YOLOv5m**: Object detection and classification
- **Xception**: Convolutional neural network architecture
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: Transformer-based image classification
